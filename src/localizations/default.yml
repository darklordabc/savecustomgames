introduction: INTRODUCTION
introduction_text: Custom Games in Dota represent a continuation of the tradition that gave birth to Dota, but morale within the custom game community is at an all time low. In the wake of the Frostivus Fiasco, many developers are feeling betrayed and ignored by Valve, feeling that developing custom games is a hopeless uphill battle against a company that doesn’t care. These developers need your help. Custom Games have a bright future but we need support and crucial fixes, which can only be provided by Valve. Help us get that message to them.

reasons:
  - title: IMPROVE COMMUNICATION
    video_webm: /images/reason_communication.webm
    video_mp4: /images/reason_communication.mp4
    text: The one thing modders need - above all else -  is communication. Its understandable that valve is not always interested in custom games and they have many different projects and creative endeavours that take up their time, but it is perfectly reasonable for 1 or 2 employees to touch base with the modding community on a regular basis. The <a href="https://discord.gg/Mvn4gww" target="_blank">modding community</a> has tried to meet valve halfway, in such ways as our extensive <a href="https://github.com/ModDota/BugTracker/issues" target="_blank">bug tracker</a>, in hope that valve will use this resource (and the pool of talent behind it), to address some very old bugs. As of now, Valve has only viewed the tracker on a few occasions, mainly when our Reddit threads containing the tracker made the front page. We know valve is capable of this type of sustained cooperation as they have done a fantastic job building the bot API with the help of the community.
  - title: FIX FREQUENT PLAYER DISCONNECTS

    video_mp4: /images/reason_disconnects.mp4
    text: For <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/7ehmdt/how_can_it_still_be_after_literally_years_that/" target="_blank">years</a>, custom games have been plagued with predictable and widespread disconnecting in the beginning phase of games. This problem affects most games, including Valve custom games, Overthrow and 10v10. This problem is usually fixed by reconnecting after a disconnect but for some custom games, this bug is more severe as reconnecting will not reload hero selection UI and they will be left in an unplayable state. The problem is entirely on Valve’s end, and unfortunately we cannot do anything about it from the standpoint as a custom game developer.
  - title: PROVIDE CHANGELOG FOR API UPDATES

    video_mp4: /images/reason_servers.mp4
    text: For a company that prides itself on <a href="https://imgur.com/jszUNxr" target="_blank">supporting</a> user generated content, it's strange that so little consideration is given for the modding community. Updating a dynamic game like DotA 2 is bound to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/5iy4k5/700_is_killing_my_custom_game_and_i_cant_do/" target="_blank">break</a> custom games sometimes, but too frequently valve makes slight or seemingly unnecessary changes (like renaming a function and then changing it back a month later) which breaks many custom games, leaving the community to scramble and try to figure out what has changed and what broke. It would be trivially easy for Valve to provide a simple changelog of updates to the API when they release updates and it would help modders recover much faster from game breaking updates.
  - title: IMPROVE DEBUGGING TOOLS

    video_mp4: /images/reason_debugging.mp4
    text: With the current state of the tools, developers have little to no ability to track down information leading to the cause of various bugs and crashes, both in the local testing client and especially in the live servers. The different types of crashes and such are wide in range, from some being as simple as a function being renamed in a recent patch, to others as complicated as an order crashing the server because the order ended up being invalid with the given parameters. This often leads to months upon months of wasted time for developers to track down these bugs and solve them with no information about the cause. Simple tools, such as the option to forward the server Lua output to the client console, or the ability to print the stack trace / view crash logs within the tools would be a great improvement for all developers alike.
  - title: AUTOMATED DEDICATED SERVERS
    video_webm: /images/reason_updates.webm
    video_mp4: /images/reason_updates.mp4
    text: Valve's <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/6n18qx/something_must_change_about_custom_games_and/" target="_blank">sporadic</a> and seemingly manual process of giving out dedicated servers to custom games has resulted in even popular games not having them, while older games that nobody plays anymore have dedicated servers. Developers have even resorted to cannibalizing older custom games entries to take advantage of their dedicated servers status (Open Angel Arena taking Pimp My Peon's Entry). Valve should instead automate the process of giving dedicated servers, so that once a game reaches a certain popularity, servers will be allocated, or reallocated if the game becomes unplayed.
